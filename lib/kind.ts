// - When a thread begins, Gemini says which it is in the same call that
//   writes the note up (no extra request), or the phone guesses from the
//   words when AI is off. Either may say "none of these" (a phone number,
//   a receipt), and then the thread has no kind.
// - After that, nothing calls the AI about it. The thread's own shape moves
//   it on: an untyped note or an idea that keeps getting notes and a next
//   step has become a project.
// - The person can set it on the thread, and then it's theirs (`pinned.kind`):
//   nothing changes it again.
